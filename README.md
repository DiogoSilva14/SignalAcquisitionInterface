# SignalAcquisitionInterface

#  1	Motivation
  
  Over the years several automated solutions have been the answer to many problems faced by companies. This project is no exception and caught our attention because we are a group of 5 students in the automation and control profile with a lot of knowledge in electronics.
  This work covers several scientific areas that relate directly to our course and therefore are areas that we are quite comfortable working in, making the development process easier.
  This team, besides having experience in these scientific areas, saw the opportunity to apply and expand their experience and knowledge in a project based in an industrialized environment.

#  2 Requirements

Gateway:
  •	Communicating with at least 8 sensor/actuator interfaces;
  •	Communicating with a PLC via Ethernet or RS-485;
  •	Translating the sensor/actuator interface communication protocol (CAN) to the PLC communica-tion protocol.

Sensor/Actuator interface:
  •	Interface with at least 8 digital sensors/actuators and 4 analogue sensors;
  •	Support 0-24V for the digital devices;
  •	Support 0-10V for the analogue devices;
  •	Sample the signals and transmit them;
  •	Communicate with the Gateway via CAN.
